# HangoutpointProject
# The Problems faced
In this project a ticket booking company is facing problems due to using a waterfall method 
An entertainment company like BookMyShow where users book their tickets have multiple users accessing their web app. Due to less infrastructure availability, they use less machines and provide the required structure. This method includes many weaknesses such as:

- Developers must wait till the complete software development for the test results.
- There is a huge possibility of bugs in the test results.
- Delivery process of the software is slow.
- The quality of software is a concern due to continuous feedback referring to things like coding or architectural issues, build failures, test conditions, and file release uploads.

# The solution
The objective is to implement the automation of the build and release process for
their product.
This was achieved by
- Setting up the Jenkins server in master or slave architecture
- Using the Jenkins plugins to perform the computation part on the Docker containers
- Creating Jenkins pipeline script
- Using the GIT web hook to schedule the job on check-in or poll SCM
- Building an image using the artifacts and deploy them on containers
- Removing the container stack after completing the job

# Steps involved

# Step 1

# Create master and slave EC2 instances in AWS
select Ubuntu 18.04 and default settings and launch instances

# Step 2

# In the master install jenkins and ansible
# Clone Repository that use ansible playbooks to install jenkins and java
 - git clone https://github.com/nalapatt/ansible-role-jenkins.git
 - git clone https://github.com/nalapatt/ansible-role-java.git
 
 # Install python
 - sudo apt install -y git zip python
 
 # Create 2 files for roles and config
git clone https://github.com/nalapatt/HangoutpointProject.git
      
 mv ansible-role-java nalapatt.java
 mv ansible-role-jenkins nalapatt.jenkins
 
 mkdir playbooks
 mkdir playbooks/roles
 mv nalapatt.j* playbooks/roles/
 mv HangoutpointProject/install-jenkins.yaml playbooks/roles/
 cp HangoutpointProject/inv.yaml inv.yaml 
 ls playbooks/roles/
 [which should show] nalapatt.java  nalapatt.jenkins install-jenkins.yml
 
 # Install Ansible
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install ansible
 # Execute Playbook
 sudo ansible-playbook -i inv.yaml playbooks/roles/install-jenkins.yaml
 
 # Enable Jenkins
 sudo systemctl status jenkins
 sudo systemctl enable jenkins 

 
# Install java and maven and configure jenkins with plugins

in a new tab open https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
Download apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip ( if this downloads on your local machine instead of in the VM either download filezilla to transfer the files into the VM

or use SCP or FTP to copy the files from your local to the azure VM)

check is the zip file is dowloaded in the terminal
unzip apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip in the terminal
sudo apt-get update
snap install openjdk
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless

In Jenkins go to Manage Jenkins
Go to Global Tool Configuration
Press Maven installations
Give a Maven name (any name you want)
Give the path ( in my case it is /home/ubuntu/apache-maven-3.6.3/ to check what the path is type pwd)
untick install automatically

Press JDk installations
Give a JDK name ( any name)
Give the path ( in my case it is usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64 )(to find path type this, update-alternatives --list java 
(the path is the ones before the jdk file)
untick install automatically
if there is an error saying this is not a jdk diretory, check the path , if correct,
maybe only the jre is installed and not the jdk. so then type this command line sudo apt install default-jdk and then try again

Press Git installations
Give a Git name (I gave git)
Give the path ( in my case it is /usr/bin/git to check what the path is type which git)
untick install automatically
Save

Go to Manage Jenkins
Manage Plugins
Maven Intergration PlugIn in the available column
Click Install without Restart

Now you will be able to see the Maven Build in the Create Job section of Jenkins
Git Plugin in the manage plugins section
Click Install without Restart
